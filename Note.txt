Test Intake System
Welcome to our testing system. Please read the instructions below.

When you click "Give me a Task" you will get to the page that will provide you with 3 options for the test tasks. All tasks are equally good and don't give advantage.
The one who completes the task faster and with quality wins
You can pick any ONE task from those three. DO NOT BUILD ALL 3!
You do not need to tell us which one you picked - just do it and provide the link to Git Repository
Once you read the description, please use ChatGPT for all clarifying questions and instructions on how to build, test and deploy the code
You must upload the resulting code to Git repository of your choice (we recommend GitHub as it's free)
You can close the window once you pick the task and come back at any time later - the timer will be ticking and you won't lose anything
We will compile and start your code
